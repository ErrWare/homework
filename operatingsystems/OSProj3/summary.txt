The project was a blast! I had a lot of fun! I learned a lot about dispatch
scheduling algorithms! I approached this project in a heads on manner! I didn't
bother designing a scalable, decoupled, cohesive architecture! I just brute
forced everything, from making multiple variables with if else logic rather
than using an array (seen in FB) to something else I brute forced! The only
difficulties are the seg faults! I think they come from using the std::queue
class! If running RR only the program seg faults! If running ALL it seg faults
as well but only after executing all commands in the main function! The end
result is a program that meets the scant criteria of the assignment! I'm so
happy that I successfully completed this project! Yippekayay kaloo kalay!
